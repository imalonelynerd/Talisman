Originally made for some friends, this webapp gives you multiple tools for your YuGiOh! games, such as a **LP display**, a **coin flip** and **dice** tool, and multiple counters.

## How does it work ?

3 "timer" modes are available, each of them with their own peculiarities :

- **Chronometer** : a simple chronometer, nothing to write home about
- **Timer** : a countdown that ends the duel once it reaches zero
- **Nexus-like** : a timer system similar to Dueling Nexus, that works like a chess timer

You can also save and load a duel preset that saves the following data :

- The duelist's **names**
- The amount of **LPs** the players are starting with
- The **timer type** and their associated parameters

This file takes the form of a **JSON** file with the **.tal** file extension.

## How do I run it ?

For now, a working webapp is available at https://imalonelynerd.fr/talisman/.
